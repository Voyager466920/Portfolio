                    PLANTABIT is more than just another productivity app—it’s a small step toward a more mindful, sustainable life.
                    At its core, PLANTABIT is a to-do list designed for the environment. Each task encourages actions that benefit the planet, from reducing plastic use to planting greenery or choosing eco-friendly transport. 
                    But more than just organizing tasks, it aims to cultivate a sense of reward and purpose in daily eco-conscious decisions.

                <p>
                    One of the key decisions I made was to keep it serverless. Many people don’t realize that servers—while invisible to most users—consume a significant amount of electricity and emit carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. 
                    By building PLANTABIT to run entirely offline with no remote backend, the app minimizes its own footprint while encouraging users to reduce theirs.

                    In terms of design, PLANTABIT was a continuation and refinement of what I learned through building FEELM. I revisited Dieter Rams-inspired principles and gave them more clarity, hierarchy, and feedback. 
                    I also built upon the local database architecture I first explored with EndingCredit, using SQFlite more deliberately to manage data in a structured, efficient way.

                <p>
                    But the most important shift was in user experience. I wanted sustainability to feel satisfying. 
                    Through small elements like confetti animations, PLANTABIT celebrates your progress—turning a to-do list into a daily moment of positive reinforcement. The app rewards not just completion, but commitment to the Earth.

                    PLANTABIT was deployed on both the App Store and Google Play. 
                    It's a personal project born out of concern for our shared future, and a reminder that even the smallest habits, when done with intention, can plant the seeds of real change.
