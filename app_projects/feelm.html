                    “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”and “Form follows function.” These two iconic principles from the Bauhaus movement have guided much of modern design—and they were the foundation for FEELM.
                    FEELM is an emotion-driven movie recommendation app, created with the intention of connecting how you feel with what you watch. 
                    It was an experiment in both design and function—an attempt to answer a simple question: What kind of film suits my mood right now?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rather than chasing trends or trying to build a competitive product, this project was more of a design study, heavily inspired by the works of Dieter Rams, the legendary designer behind Braun. 
                    I focused on clarity, restraint, and usability—trying to replicate Rams’ “less but better” approach using Flutter, one element at a time.

                    At the time, AI technology wasn't as mature or widely available as it is today, so FEELM did not use machine learning or neural networks. 
                    Instead, it relied on a basic numerical recommendation system based on manually assigned emotion tags and film metadata. While simple, this system aimed to keep the experience lightweight and intuitive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, building a highly structured visual design in Flutter came with its challenges. 
                    Every visual and interactive element had to be hand-crafted, and as the design fidelity increased, so did the app’s weight and complexity. Performance and scalability became notable trade-offs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still, despite its limitations, FEELM made it to both the App Store and Google Play, and it serves as a cornerstone of work that reflects my early exploration of design systems, emotional UX, and human-centered interaction.
