                    I've always had a habit of writing down thoughts, especially right after watching a movie. There’s something about the quiet moments during the ending credits—the lights dimmed, the emotions still fresh—that makes it the perfect time to reflect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a simple, serverless app built with SQFlite and Flutter, designed to let you quickly capture your thoughts while the credits roll. 
                    Whether it's a memorable quote, a subtle detail, or just your feelings at that moment, Ending Credit gives you a quiet space to write it all down. The app was deployed on both the App Store and Google Play.

                    This was my first app project ever, and it came entirely from a personal need. I wasn’t trying to build something for a market—I just wanted a tool that helped me preserve the things I noticed before they faded away. 
                    That mindset shaped every decision, from the minimalist interface to the way notes are stored locally without needing an account or network connection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But building this app wasn’t simple. Flutter in the early 2020s had its limitations—especially when it came to local databases, state management, and platform-specific design polish.
                    Design was another area of constant iteration. I wanted the app to feel cinematic and quiet, almost like part of the movie itself. 
                    Supporting both light and dark mode was essential, and I made sure the UI adjusted smoothly based on the system theme. Typography, spacing, and color were all carefully considered to keep users focused on their words, not the interface.
                    The desire for better design led me to the next project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally, I planned to include movie poster images as part of the interface, thinking it would make the experience more visually engaging. But after submitting the app for review, Apple contacted me with a copyright warning related to Disney and Pixar assets. It was a wake-up call about the importance of rights and ownership—even in a personal project. As a result, I redesigned the app around a more minimal, text-focused experience. 
                    In the end, that shift aligned more closely with the original intent: to focus on personal reflection, not flashy visuals.
